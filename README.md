## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Inherent Risk Calculation
```
Inherent Risk = Likelihood (1-5) √ó Impact (1-5)
```

### Residual Risk Calculation
```
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk √ó Control Effectiveness Factor

Control Effectiveness Factors:
- Ineffective: 0.9 (10% reduction)
- Partially Effective: 0.7 (30% reduction)
- Effective: 0.4 (60% reduction)
- Highly Effective: 0.2 (80% reduction)
```

### Risk Level Classification
- **Critical**: 20-25 points
- **High**: 15-19 points
- **Medium**: 10-14 points
- **Low-Medium**: 6-9 points
- **Low**: 1-5 points

## Customization

### Adding New Risk Categories
1. Update `GAAP_RISK_CATEGORIES` in `src/types/risk-assessment.ts`
2. Add new category data in `src/data/gaap-audit-data.ts`
3. The dashboard will automatically include the new category

### Modifying Risk Factors
Edit the risk factor arrays in `src/data/gaap-audit-data.ts` to:
- Add new risk factors
- Update descriptions and mitigation actions
- Adjust risk scores and ownership

### Styling Changes
The application uses Tailwind CSS. Modify component classes or extend the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Data Persistence

Currently, the application uses in-memory state management. For production use, consider integrating:
- Database storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- User authentication and authorization
- Audit trail logging
