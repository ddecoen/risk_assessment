# GAAP Audit Risk Assessment Dashboard

A comprehensive web application for managing and visualizing risk assessments for your first annual GAAP audit. This dashboard focuses on five critical areas: Revenue Recognition, Materiality, COGS Allocation, Segregation of Duties, and Supervision & Review.

## Features

### 📊 Overview Dashboard
- **Summary Cards**: Quick view of total risks, critical/high risks, and progress metrics
- **Risk Categories**: Interactive cards showing each of the 5 GAAP focus areas
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion status
- **Expandable Details**: Click on categories to view detailed risk factors

### 🎯 Risk Matrix Visualization
- **Interactive Risk Matrix**: 5x5 grid plotting likelihood vs impact
- **Color-coded Risk Levels**: Visual representation of risk severity
- **Risk Distribution**: See how risks are distributed across the matrix
- **Hover Details**: Quick access to risk information

### ✏️ Detailed Assessment Forms
- **Editable Risk Factors**: Update risk details, scores, and mitigation actions
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic inherent and residual risk calculations
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress from "Not Started" to "Completed"
- **Owner Assignment**: Track responsibility for each risk factor

## Risk Categories Covered

### 1. Revenue Recognition
- Premature revenue recognition risks
- Complex contract terms interpretation
- Revenue cut-off procedures

### 2. Materiality
- Materiality threshold determination
- Qualitative materiality factors
- Industry benchmarking

### 3. COGS Allocation
- Customer support cost allocation across service lines
- Service delivery cost classification (COGS vs OpEx)
- Third-party service provider cost allocation
- Employee time allocation accuracy

### 4. Segregation of Duties
- Financial reporting process controls
- System access management
- Approval hierarchy implementation

### 5. Supervision and Review

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Inherent Risk Calculation
```
Inherent Risk = Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5)
```

### Residual Risk Calculation
```
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Effectiveness Factor

Control Effectiveness Factors:
- Ineffective: 0.9 (10% reduction)
- Partially Effective: 0.7 (30% reduction)
- Effective: 0.4 (60% reduction)
- Highly Effective: 0.2 (80% reduction)
```

### Risk Level Classification
- **Critical**: 20-25 points
- **High**: 15-19 points
- **Medium**: 10-14 points
- **Low-Medium**: 6-9 points
- **Low**: 1-5 points

## Customization

### Adding New Risk Categories
1. Update `GAAP_RISK_CATEGORIES` in `src/types/risk-assessment.ts`
2. Add new category data in `src/data/gaap-audit-data.ts`
3. The dashboard will automatically include the new category

### Modifying Risk Factors
Edit the risk factor arrays in `src/data/gaap-audit-data.ts` to:
- Add new risk factors
- Update descriptions and mitigation actions
- Adjust risk scores and ownership

### Styling Changes
The application uses Tailwind CSS. Modify component classes or extend the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Data Persistence

Currently, the application uses in-memory state management. For production use, consider integrating:
- Database storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- User authentication and authorization
- Audit trail logging
